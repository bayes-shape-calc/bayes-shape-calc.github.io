# Overview
Searching for, identifying, and validating the shape of a certain dataset is a very common practice in data analysis. Typically, this is implemented manually or using broadly heuristic methods. We have developed a Bayesian method of calculating the intrinsic shape of data. The general method uses probability theory and Bayes' rule to select the best shape for a specific dataset given the uncertainty present in this estimation due to noise and other nuisance parameters. By providing analytical formulas to determine the shape of data, this approach enables a machine learning-based method to analyze experiments that were previously done heuristically or "by eye". It is a broad, easily generalizable method that can be applied to many techniques in the physical sciences. 

This work was developed as a collaboration between the [Kinz-Thompson](https://ckinzthompson.github.io/) and [Gonzalez](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/gonzalez/) labs. This website serves as a home-page for all applications for this Bayesian shape calculation method. As particular implementations are developed, they will be aggregated here.
