# Overview
This is the landing page for a Bayesian method of calculating the intrinsic shape of data. The general method uses probability theory and Bayes' rule to select the best shape given the uncertainty present in this estimation due to noise. By providing analytical formulas to determine the shape of data, this approach enables a machine learning-based method to analyze experiments that were previously done "by eye".
