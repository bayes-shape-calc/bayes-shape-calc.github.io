# Overview
Searching for, identifying, and validating the shape of experimental datasets is an important component of scientific data analysis. Typically, these shape-based tasks are implemented manually or using broadly heuristic methods. We have developed a Bayesian method to objectively calculate the intrinsic shape of data using probability theory. This general method uses Bayes' rule to select the best shape for a specific dataset given the uncertainty present in the estimation due to noise and other nuisance parameters. By providing analytical formulas to determine the shape of data, we hope to enable a machine learning-based approach to analyses that were previously done heuristically or "by eye". The method demonstrated here is broad, readily generalizable, and can be applied to many techniques in the physical and life sciences. 

This work was developed as a collaboration between the [Kinz-Thompson](https://ckinzthompson.github.io/) and [Gonzalez](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/gonzalez/) labs. This website serves as a home-page for all applications for this Bayesian shape calculation method. As particular implementations are developed, they will be aggregated here.
